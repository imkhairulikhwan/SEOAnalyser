# SEO Analyser

SEO Analyser is a web application that performs a simple SEO analysis of the text.

User submits a text in English or URL, 

- Filters out stop-words (e.g. ‘or’, ‘and’, ‘a’, ‘the’ etc), 
- Calculates number of occurrences of each word, 
- Number of occurrences on the page of each word listed in meta tags, 
- Number of external links in the text

This is a rough idea of the process of this system.

**Installation Instruction**

These are the few steps required to set up all the environments in your machine.

First of all you need docker to be set up in your machine. 
For me I am running on Windos OS which my docker containers will be running on Linux settings
You can go to (https://www.docker.com/community-edition) to get the latest version of docker downloads

Go to powershell
Run this command to bring up all the applications and environments in docker

```
docker-compose up -d
```

Once the environment is being brought up you will have the list of application running on your machine.

The idea of this architecture is that, when a user click on the **CheckUp Text** button, the application will received the url or a bulk text. The API will then store the input to Redis and return a token ID to the Client side and perform 3 API calls simultaneously from the client to get the necessary info.
